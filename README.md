# DLS Tax and Accounting 

[View the live project here](https://samharms.github.io/MS1/)

This website was created to demonstrate my front-end skills for Milestone Project 1 of Code Institute’s Full Stack Developer course. 
The purpose of the project was to create a static website. The website was also built as a template for a new website for my employer, DLS Tax and Accounting, which is more modern and streamlined than their current website to attract a new younger client base.
